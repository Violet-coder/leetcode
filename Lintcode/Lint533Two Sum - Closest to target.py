Description
Given an array nums of n integers, find two integers in nums such that the sum is closest to a given number, target.
Return the absolute value of difference between the sum of the two numbers and the target.
Example1
Input:  nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4] and target = 4
Output: 1
Explanation:
The minimum difference is 1. (4 - (2 + 1) = 1).
Example2

Input:  nums = [-1, -1, -1, -4] and target = 4
Output: 6
Explanation:
The minimum difference is 6. (4 - (- 1 - 1) = 6).
