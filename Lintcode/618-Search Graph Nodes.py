"""
Given a undirected graph, a node and a target, return the nearest node to given node which value of it is target, return NULL if you can't find.
There is a mapping store the nodes' values in the given parameters.
Example 1:
Input:
{1,2,3,4#2,1,3#3,1,2#4,1,5#5,4}
[3,4,5,50,50]
1
50
Output:
4

      1 --4
Give a node 1, target is 50
there a hash named values which is [3,4,10,50,50], represent:
Value of node 1 is 3
Value of node 2 is 4
Value of node 3 is 10
Value of node 4 is 50
Value of node 5 is 50
Return node 4
Example 2:
Input:
{1,2#2,1}
[0,1]
1
1
Output:
2
